# Posts Table App

This is a simple React application that fetches posts from a public API, displays them in a table, and allows you to add new posts. The app utilizes Material-UI for styling and Axios for making API requests.

## Features
- Displays a list of posts fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Allows adding new posts with a title and a "completed" status.
- The posts are displayed in a table with user ID, title, and completion status.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to the local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone - https://github.com/Risidio/frontend_api_assement.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project folder

Change your directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd frontend_api_assement
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install or npm i  & npm i @mui/material & npm i scss & npm i @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

This will install all the packages listed in `package.json`.

### 4. Run the application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and the app will be available at [http://localhost:5173]

### 5. Open the app
